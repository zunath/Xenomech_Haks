This repository holds all of the hakpak content used on the Star Wars: Legends of the Old Republic server for Neverwinter Nights. 

These files can be packed into hakpaks by running the "CompileSWLOR.exe" program. Simply run this, wait for it to finish and then find the packed files in the output folder.

If you have any questions or issues please contact us on the Discord.
